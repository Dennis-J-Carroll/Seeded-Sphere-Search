Allied Medical Sciences stood out like a cut diamond in a handful
of gravel. "Wanted," it read, "Veterinarian--for residency in active

Nothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on the level.

take more than a thousand Galactic Standard years to visit them all, and
a man could look forward to scarcely more than five hundred at best. The
habitat of Man had become too large. There wasn't time to explore every
position that fitted. The trouble was--if the standards were too high
the jobs were too scarce. Despite the chronic shortage of veterinarians
throughout the Brotherhood, there was a peculiar reluctance on the part
of established practitioners to welcome recent graduates. Most of the
ads in the professional journals read "State salary desired," which was
nothing more than economic blackmail--a bald-faced attempt to get as
much for as little as possible. Kennon grimaced wryly. He'd be damned if
he'd sell his training for six thousand a year. Slave labor, that's what
it was. There were a dozen ads like that in the Journal. Well, he'd give
them a trial, but he'd ask eight thousand and full GEA benefits. Eight

wall. Albertsville was a nice town, too young for slums, too new for
overpopulation. The white buildings were the color of winter butter in
the warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in the noonday heat. It
nestled snugly in the center of a bowl-shaped valley whose surrounding
forest clad hills gave mute confirmation to the fact that Kardon
was still primitive, an unsettled world that had not yet reached the
explosive stage of population growth that presaged maturity. But that
was no disadvantage. In fact, Kennon liked it. Living could be fun on a

it. The address, 200 Central Avenue, was only a few blocks away. In

of durilium and plastic, soaring above the others on the street, the

Alexander, President of Outworld Enterprises--a lean, dark, wolfish man
in his early sixties--eyed Kennon with a flat predatory intentness that
was oddly disquieting. His stare combined the analytical inspection
of the pathologist, the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist, and the
weighing appraisal of the butcher. Kennon's thoughts about Alexander's
youth vanished that instant. Those eyes belonged to a leader on the
a smothering wave. Grimly he fought it down, knowing it was a sign of
straight lines in his face into friendly curves. "Business, Dr. Kennon,

shrugged and seated himself in the chair beside the desk. The quiet was
broken only by the rustle of paper as the two rapt-faced men turned page

noticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his autohypnotic trance. Kennon

The ship landed gently on a pitted concrete slab near the massive
radiation shields of the barricaded entranceway to the fortress.
Projectors in polished dually turrets swivelled to point their ugly

his future to automatic machinery. If the analyzers failed to decode the

Two women came out of the darkness, moving with quiet graceful steps
across the blistering hot concrete. They were naked except for a
loincloth, halter, and sandals and so nearly identical in form and
feature that Kennon took them to be twins. Their skins were burned a

dominant life form there until men had come. Now they were just another
animal added to humanity's growing list of pets and livestock. The
little Varl with their soft-furred bodies and clever six-fingered hands
made excellent pets and precision workmen. The products of those clever
hands, the tiny instruments, the delicate microminiaturized control
circuits, the incredibly fine lacework and tapestries, formed the bulk

Two thousand years of human domination had left them completely
dependent on their conquerors. They were merely intelligent animals--and
that was all they would ever be until the human race changed its
cultural pattern or was overthrown. The one alternative was as unlikely
as the other. Humanity had met some fierce competitors, but none with
its explosive acquisitive nature, and none with its drive to conquer,
fierceness and the greed of men. But unlike most others, the Varl were

their delicate bodies could not stand the strains of spaceflight.
They were trapped on their world. Why should they be forced into so
subordinate a role?--Why was humanity so jealous of its dominance
that no other species could exist except by sufferance? Why after five
thousand years of exploration, invasion, and colonization did the human
race still consider the galaxy as its oyster, and themselves uniquely
qualified to hold the knife? He hadn't thought this way since he had
given the Varl to his girl friend of the moment, and had blasted off for
Beta. Now the questions returned to haunt him. As a Betan, the haunting
was even more acute, since Beta had a related problem that was already

each busy with his own thoughts. And behind the view wall of Alexander's
apartment Kardon's brilliant yellow sun sank slowly toward the horizon,
filling the sky with flaming colors of red and gold, rimmed by the blues
and purples of approaching night. The sunset was gaudy and blatant,

volumes about generations of breeding for physical elegance. They moved
with a co-ordinated grace that made Douglas look even more clumsy by
contrast. And they were identical, twin cream-and-gold works of art.

thoroughly unpleasant specimen, and incidentally quite typical of the

that combined disgust and resignation. "Sometimes I wonder why I have
sickened him. There were several ways to produce that expression, all of
them unpleasant. Hypnoconditioning, the Quiet Treatment, brainburning,
transorbital leukotomy, lobectomy--all of the products of that diseased

men in an effort to cure psychic states. Psychiatry had passed that

thousand, and a first-class action like a Humanity Trial could cost
over a million. Grandfather found that out. Sure, there are differences
between Lani and humans, but a smart lawyer can make them seem trivial
until the final test and that would drag on for nearly two years until
all the requirements were satisfied--and by that time the unfavorable
publicity would drop sales to zero. The Family would be on my neck for
mutation, but so far as we know it hasn't happened in human history. As
a result, the tail serves as a trade-mark--something that can be easily
recognized by anyone. So we sell them intact." Alexander crossed his
human--at first. They learn better, but adjustment is always a strain.
They keep confusing external appearances with the true article. But
remember this--Lani are not human. They're animals. And on this island
they're treated as what they are--no more, no less. They are a part
of our economics and are bred, fed, and managed according to sound
livestock principles. Despite some of the things you may see here in
Alexandria, don't forget that. You are a veterinarian. Your job is to
handle disease problems in animals. Lani are animals. Therefore you will
be doing your job. I was disappointed in your reaction when you first
saw them, but I suppose it was natural. At any rate this should clear

something of the appearance of a Sarkian harem. Although there were only
five of the Alexander family present, there were at least twenty
Lani whose costumes ranged from the black G string and halter of the
household staff to the utter nudity of Douglas's playthings. They were
with his sulky expression, an older man in his late nineties who looked
like Douglas's elder brother, two mature women who could be any age from
fifty to three hundred, and a girl. She might have been thirty--perhaps
younger, perhaps older, a lean feminine edition of Alexander, with the
same intriguing face and veiled predatory look. There was a hardness
about her that was absent in the others. Kennon had the feeling that

followed were in proper form, and Kennon was beginning to feel more at
ease until Eloise sent one of her Lani with a summons. He looked around
for Alexander, but the entrepreneur was the center of a three-cornered
argument, hemmed in by Douglas, Henry, and Anne. Henry's voice was
raised in bitter protest that Alexander was exceeding his authority. He

If anything, she was worse since she had enough money to implement her

mantrap. He stood up and bowed Betan fashion. "I see your brother is
free now. He wants to brief me on my duties here. We were discussing it
a poor employee if I delayed him." He grinned knowingly at her and she
left a bottle or two, although I suspect the old sinner hung on until
wryly. "At that, though, you have a point." The two men slipped quietly
from the room. Apparently none of the Family was conscious of their
departure except Eloise, who watched them leave with an enigmatic
winding path that led to the cluster of buildings in the valley below.

vegetation, clean pleasant odors in contrast to what he had left. In the
distance a bird called sleepily from one of the fortress turrets and was
answered by some creature Kennon couldn't identify. A murmur of blended
sound came from the valley below, punctuated by high-pitched laughter.
Someone was singing, or perhaps chanting would be a better description.
The melody was strange and the words unrecognizable. The thin whine
of an atomotor in the fortress's generating plant slowly built up to a
It's almost as though we shut those people out of existence by merely
mock comfort. "Douglas is on the Otpens for a year, and the others are
Actually he's more qualified than I. He knows everything worth knowing
about this place. We're going past his house in a minute--want to stop
business." Alexander swung sharply to the left and climbed a short
flight of stairs that led to the nearest house. Lights flared on the
deep porch, and the old-fashioned iris door dilated to frame the black
a solid quiet man with a craggy face and the deep-set eyes of a Mystic.
His skin had the typical thickness and pore prominence of the dwellers
on that foggy world from which he came. But unlike the natives of Myst,
his skin was burned a dark brown by Kardon's sun. He seemed out of place
on this tropic world, but Kennon reflected wryly that there was probably

died this morning, and there's three more that look pretty bad,
jaundice, no appetite, complaining of muscular pains. Same symptoms as
took the others. The one this morning makes the fourth this month, and

blankly at Kennon and then brightened as she saw Jordan. "What's the

to the switchboard beside the door and punched five buttons. Four more

Over forty generations so far, and from the looks of things we can go on
everything. All I know is that we get results. Old Doc knew how it was
belaboring the point. He turned to the staff. Five of them were the
same big-boned heavy-framed type that apparently did most of the
manual labor. The sixth, the late arrival, was an elegant creature, a
bronze-skinned, green-eyed minx with an elfin face half hidden under a
wavy mass of red-brown hair. Unlike the others, she had been docked--and
in contrast to their heavy eyes and sleep-puffed features she was alert

Old Doc left a fine collection of notes on Lani anatomy and perhaps you
the Lani led the way to a door which opened into a good-sized office,
liberally covered with bookshelves. An old-fashioned plastic desk, some
office cybernetics, a battered voicewriter, and a few chairs completed
the furnishings. The redhead placed several large folio volumes in front
of him and stepped back from the desk as he leafed rapidly through
the color plates. It was an excellent atlas. Dr. Williamson had been a
Lani viscera, Kennon looked up at the redhead. She was still standing
the pitiless light of the fluorescents. She had been hardly more than a
child. Kennon felt a twinge of pity--so young--so young to die. And as
an offer to study human medicine because of his aversion to dissecting
cadavers. The sarcoplastic models were all right, but when it came to
flesh, Kennon didn't have the stomach for it. And now, the sight of the
dead humanoid brought back the same cold sweat and gut-wrenching nausea

essentially normal. And he knew with cold certainty that he could not
lay a scalpel edge upon that cold flesh. It was too human, too like his
pathologist did his own dissection. He examined. And that he could do.
It was the tactile, not the visual sensations that upset him. He nodded.
An excellent prosectress, Kennon thought. Kennon pointed at the swollen
liver and the Lani deftly severed its attachments and laid the organ
out for inspection. The cause of death was obvious. The youngster had
succumbed to a massive liver-fluke infestation. It was the worst he
had ever seen. The bile ducts were thick, calcified and choked with
differences, the lesions were identical. He removed a few of the flukes
qualities of a crime hunt. Now he must act to prevent further murders,
to reconstruct the crime, to find the modus operandi, to track the fluke
to be identified and its sensitivity to therapy determined. Studies
would have to be made on its life cycle, and the means by which it
gained entrance to its host. It wouldn't be simple, because this
trematode was probably Hepatodirus hominis, and it was tricky. It

symptomatic treatment. He sighed and rose slowly to his feet. Tomorrow

Lani might be human. And we've gone to a great deal of trouble to prove

Grandfather was a clever man. After he had secured this island he
became worried about the surviving Lani. He didn't want to be accused
of genocide, since the Lani were so human in appearance. So he had his
medical officer make a few autopsies. The M.D. reported that while there
court was sitting in Halsey and the hearing was private. Even so, it
leaked and Grandfather was highly unpopular for a time until the lab
reports came in. It cost him over eight hundred Ems and nearly two
years' time to finish the case, but when it was over the Lani were
and three court-appointed M.O.'s went through them with microscopes.
They didn't miss a thing. Their reports are so detailed that they're
classics of their kind. They're almost required reading for anyone
who wants to learn Lani structure and function. The court rendered
an interim decision that the Lani were nonhuman, and armed with this,
Grandfather prepared the final tests which were run by a team of
court-appointed medics and biologists, who made in vitro and live tests
on a number of Lani female prisoners. The tests ran for over two years
and were totally negative. So the Alexander family acquired Flora and
the Otpens, and a legal status." Alexander stood up. "Well--that's a
capsule summary. The records are in the library if you'd care to check
enough. For a moment Kennon debated whether he should see him home--and
then decided against it. If Alexander needed help he'd have asked for
it. As it was, it was better to leave things alone. Certainly he didn't
know Alexander well enough to act as a guardian. He turned back to the
living area. The stereo was playing something soft and nostalgic as
Kennon sank into the chair Alexander had vacated. He let his body relax.
It had been as full a day as he had ever spent filled with changes
so abrupt that they were exhausting. He felt confused. There were no
precedents he could apply. Neither his studies nor his travels had
intelligent, upright, bipedal mammals whose morphology was so close to
man's that it had taken the ultimate test to settle their status. And
being a Betan, Kennon was suspicious of the accuracy of that ultimate
pervaded mankind's expanding empire was its product. From almost the
beginning of mankind's leap to the stars it had been recognized that men
must help each other or perish. The spirit of co-operation against the
common enmity of alien worlds and cultures transcended the old petty
developed its muscles in a thousand battles on a thousand hostile
worlds. And ultimately it evolved into the only form of central
authority that men would accept. Yet basically it was not a government.
It was an attitude of mind. Men accepted its decisions as they would
enforce them. After all, it didn't need to. It also arbitrated disputes,
admitted new worlds to membership, and organized concerted human effort
against dangerous enemies. And that was all. Yet in its sphere the
Brotherhood--membership in the human race. No matter how decadent or
primitive a population might be, if it was human it was automatically
eligible for Brotherhood--a free and equal partner in the society of
of humanity, although individuals might have done so. A docked Lani, for
instance, would probably pass unquestioned as a human, but the Lani race
would not. In consequence they and their world were fair prey, and had
forms were obviously alien. But there were a few--like the Lani--where
similarities were so close that it was impossible to determine their
status on the basis of morphology alone. And so the Humanity Test had
like can interbreed with like. Tests conducted on every inhabited world
in the Brotherhood had proven this conclusively. Whatever changes had
taken place in the somatic characteristics of mankind since the Exodus,
they had not altered the compatibility of human germ plasm. Man could
interbreed with man--aliens could not. The test was simple. The results
were observable. And what was more important, everyone could understand
qualifying phrases were those of the scientist, that strange breed that
refuses to accept anything as an established fact until it is proven
beyond a shadow of a doubt. After all, the human race had been
spaceborne for only six thousand years--scarcely time for any real
differences to develop. But physical changes had already appeared--and
it would only be a question of time before these would probably be
followed by genetic changes. And in some groups the changes might be
the rest of humanity. Already the radiations of Beta's variant-G sun had
produced changes in the population. Little things like tougher
epidermis and depilation of body hair--little things that held alarming
implications to Beta's scientists, and to Beta's people. Not too many
generations hence a Betan outside his home system would be a rarity,
and in a few millennia the Betan system itself would be a closed enclave
peopled by humans who had deviated too far from the basic stock to
there was no assurance that this would happen. And mankind had a history
come to the same conclusion. Possibly there were. And possibly there
were worlds where marked deviations had occurred. There wasn't a year
that passed that didn't bring some new human world into the Brotherhood,
and many of these had developed from that cultural explosion during the
First Millennium known as the Exodus, where small groups of colonists in
inadequate ships set out for unannounced goals to homestead new worlds
for man. Some of these survived, and many were being discovered even
at this late date. But so far none had any difficulty in proving their
groups, which probably explained the extreme care the Brotherhood
courts had taken with their case. But they had failed the test, and
were declared animals. Yet it was possible that they had mutated beyond
genetic compatibility. If they had, and if it were proved, here was a
test case that could rock the galaxy--that could shake the Brotherhood
to its very foundations--that could force a re-evaluation of the
day on the job, dreaming how he could ruin his employer, shake the
foundation of human civilization, and force ten thousand billion humans
to change their comfortable habit patterns and their belief in the
unchangeable sameness of men. He was, he reflected wryly, an incurable

composed of equal parts of relief and exasperation as he slipped out of
bed and began to dress. He'd forgo the shower this morning. He had no
desire for Copper to appear and offer to scrub his back. In his present

the feeling that I'm going to wake up any minute." He looked at his
reflection in the dresser mirror, and his reflection looked worriedly
back. "This whole thing has an air of plausible unreality: the
advertisement, the contract, this impossible island that raises
humanoids as part of the livestock." He shrugged and his mirrored image
shrugged back. "But it's real, all right. No dream could possibly be

years? Probably not too well," he mused silently. "Already I'm talking

no native of one world had a right to force his customs down the
unwilling throat of another. It would be better to accept his present
situation and live with it rather than trying to impose his Betan
conception of morality upon Lani that neither understood nor appreciated
it. His business was to treat and prevent animal disease. What happened
to the animals before infection or after recovery was none of his
vehicle that squatted with an air of unpolished efficiency on the
graveled drive behind his house. He smiled a quick greeting as Kennon
approached. "It's about time you showed up," he said. "You'll have to
get into the habit of rising early on this place. We do most of our work
early in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the day it's too
hot to breathe, let alone work. Well, let's get going. There's still
jeep today," he said. "They aren't very pretty, but they get around." He
turned onto the surfaced road that ran down the hill toward the hospital
and the complex of red-roofed buildings clustered about it. "About those
hangouts, study his modus operandi, and learn how to make his victims
secure from his activities. Unless we do that, we can treat individuals
from now to infinity and all we'll have is more cases. We have to apply
modern criminology tactics--eliminate the source of crime--stop up the
night, and I saw nothing about trematodes, or anything that looked like
on Santos so far as we know. In fact, some people think that the Varl
bred it for a weapon to use against us before we conquered them. They
could have done it. Their biological science was of a high enough
him go because he was a nudist. It made a bad impression on the Lani.
The fatal cases usually don't show up before an area is pretty well
concentrated into groups. And so far there doesn't seem to be any
infestation outside of Hillside Station--except for two deaths in Lani
recently sent from there. If we quarantine those stations and work fast,
at the hospital. If there aren't we'll get them. We'll take the
sick ones back to the hospital area and push therapy and supportive
treatment. Now that we know the cause, we shouldn't have any more death
than a training center. Perhaps Old Doc was trained in outcall work, but
I'm not. I work from a hospital. The only things I do on outcalls are
diagnoses, vaccinations, and emergencies. The rest of the patients come

There simply won't be time to run all over the island dosing with
Trematox and taking temperatures, and while that sort of thing is
routine, it should be supervised. Besides, you'll see the advantages of
two Lani carrying bags which they loaded into the back of the jeep.
"I had to reorganize a little," Kennon apologized, "some things were
for fast transport. Most of the roads aren't so good." He engaged the
drive and the jeep began to move. "We'll go cross country," he said.
"Hillside's pretty far out--the farthest station since we abandoned
increased the power to the drive and set the machine on automatic.
"We'll get a pretty good cross-section of our operations on this trip,"
impressed. The size of this operation was beginning to sink in. It
hadn't looked so big from the substratosphere in Alexander's ship, but
down here close to the ground it was enormous. Fields of grain, wide
orchards, extensive gardens. Once they were forced to detour a huge
supply boat that rose heavily in front of them. Working in the fields
were dozens of brown-skinned Lani who paused to look up and wave as
the jeep sped by. Occasional clusters of farm buildings and the low
have a few who are descendants of the crew of the first Alexander, and
there's one old codger who was actually with him during the conquest.
Most of our stationmasters are family men. We feel that a wife and
children add to a man's stability--and incidentally keep him from
luxury-trade items. The big sale items are beef, pork, and mutton."
Blalok chuckled. "Did you think that the Lani were our principal
agriculture--is our main source of income. The Lani are valuable
principally to keep down the cost of overhead. Virtually all of them
work right here on the island. We don't sell more than a hundred a year
less than five per cent of our total. And those are surplus--too light
in space-train range. We can produce more cheaply than any competitor,
and we can undersell any competition, even full automation." Blalok
chuckled. "There are some things that a computer can't do as well as
a human being, and one of them is farm the foods on which humanity is
accustomed to feed. A man'll pay two credits for a steak. He could get a
Chlorella substitute for half a credit, but he'll still buy the steak
if he can afford it. Same thing goes for fruit, vegetables, grain, and
garden truck. Man's eating habits have only changed from necessity.
Those who can pay will still pay well for natural foods." Blalok
chuckled. "We've put quite a dent in the algae and synthetics operations
does us no harm. We keep enough for servants--and the others would be
inefficient for most farm work. So disposal by sale is a logical and
profitable way of culling. But now the Boss-man is being pressured into
breeding an export type. And this I don't like. It's too commercial.
fatheaded Brotherhood economists call our system economic slavery--and
I'll admit that it's pretty hard to crack out of a spherical trust.
But that doesn't mean that we have to stay where we are. Mystics aren't
owned by their entrepreneurs. Sure, it's a tough haul to beat the
boss, but it can be done. I did it, and others do it all the time. The
Lani have? Without us they can't even keep going as a race. They're
technological morons. They don't live long enough to understand modern
civilization. To turn those poor helpless humanoids out into human
society would be criminal. It's our duty to protect them even while
Boss-man the facts--but I can't get nerve enough to try. I've a good job
here--a wife and two kids--and I don't want to jeopardize my future."
Blalok glanced over the side. "Well, here we are," he said, and began
descending into the center of a spokelike mass of buildings radiating
replacement and export. It can turn out over a thousand a year at
full capacity. Of course we don't run at that rate, or Flora would be
overpopulated. But this is a big layout, like you said. It can maintain
for the past half hour," he said. "Your office said you were on your
way.--Good to see you, too, Doc. I've been going over the records with
hand. The gesture was as old as man, its ritualistic meaning lost in
compare origins later. Right now, you'd better come into the office.

rotate the youngsters around the bay--a different bay each year until
they're age eleven. Then they're sorted according to type and sent out
for a year of further specialized training after which they go onto the
Nine, but Bay Ten has had all our losses except two that have occurred

the damage is a flatworm, a trematode called Hepatodirus hominis. As
I've told Blalok, it's a tricky thing. Like all trematodes it has a
three-stage life cycle, but unlike every other fluke, its life cycle is
not fixed to definite intermediate hosts. Depending upon where it is,
the fluke adapts. It still must pass through its life cycle, but its
intermediate host need not be one species of snail, fish, or copepod.
Any cold-blooded host will do. What you have here is a Kardonian variant
which has adapted to some particular intermediate host on this world.
Until now, its final host was either man or Varl. Now we have a third,
the Lani. And apparently they are the most susceptible of the three.
It never kills Varl. And humans, while they're more susceptible, only
occasionally succumb, but the Lani appear to be the most susceptible of
all. I've never seen an infestation like those Lani had. Their livers
were literally crawling with flukes." Kennon paused and looked at
technique is thousands of years old, but it's just as good today as it
and like I said, it adapts. Its intermediate host can be any one of a
subacute dosage to propagate it until the time is right for another
epizootic. We have to kill its intermediate host--or hosts if it has
more than one. That will keep it from growing and will ultimately
habits of the Lani. Then we check each individual Lani. Then we check
the life cycle of the parasite. Somewhere along the line if we're lucky
we're on an isolated land mass. That gives us an advantage. We should be
minimum--and I wouldn't care to guess at the maximum. However, I hope
the idea in your head that you're facing something here that can cripple
you--maybe abort your whole operation. You have a choice--interrupt now
or abort later. And half measures won't work. To eradicate this pest
of telling how far this spreads until the death losses occur. Our tests
for fluke infestation aren't that good. We have to work thoroughly and
carefully. We can't be butting heads over this--either we all co-operate
disease. Five months ago Old Doc and two Lani were ill. Four months ago
one of the two Lani was dead and Old Doc was too ill to be effective.
Three months ago Old Doc and the other Lani were dead, and before the
end of the month two more followed them. Two months ago six died, last
month eight, and so far this month you've lost four and you have over
two weeks to go. Up to now they've all been from here, but two this
month were at other stations. In six months if nothing is done, we'll
be having losses there unless we're lucky. And the losses will keep
on increasing. Apparently you don't know what it is to live with
graduates, Kennon reflected as he checked the monthly reports from the
Stations. Since the time he had laid down the law to Judson and Blalok,
he had had no trouble from the production staff. And for the past four
months there had been no further trouble with Hepatodirus. That unwanted
visitor had apparently been evicted. At that, they had been lucky. The
parasite had been concentrated at Hillside Station and had failed to
establish itself in the training area. The intermediate host, it had
turned out, was a small amphibian that was susceptible to commercial
insecticide. It had been no trouble to eradicate. Systemic treatment and
cooking of all food had cleaned up the infective cercaria and individual
infections, and after six months of intensive search, quarantine, and
investigation, Kennon was morally certain that the disease had been
that his ideas were right. The hospital was operating as a hospital
should, with a staff of twelve Lani kept busy checking the full wards.
Actually, it was working better than it should, since stationmasters all
over the island were now shipping in sick animals rather than treating
hundred and two days in our year, ten thirty-day months and two special
months to go. But how come the ten-month year? Most other planets have
sweat from his face. "What with this infernal heat and their eternal
and shrakes were almost as bad. You can't get away from soil saprophytes
no matter how clean you are. Under a pasture setup there's always
a chance of contamination. And that old cliche about an ounce of
prevention is truer of livestock raising than anything else I can think
mess, but Alexander thinks it's profitable. Someone's told him that
pound for pound chickens are the most efficient feed converters of all
the domestic animals. So we're getting a pilot plant: eggs, incubator,
and a knocked-down broiler battery so we can try the idea out.
The Boss-man is always hot on new ideas to increase efficiency and
production. The only trouble is that he fails to consider the work

for a while that he'd be looking for another job. But Alexander had been

it was a physical pain. Other Lani had told her about men and what they

some advice when Man Allworth had tattooed the tiny V on her thigh that
meant she had been selected for the veterinary staff. And when Old Doc
had brought her from the Training Station to the hospital and removed
her tail, she was certain that she was one of the lucky ones who would

our young were the fruit of love rather than the product of our masters'
cunning. But you may know the flower even though you cannot bear its

You are not his natural mate. You cannot bear his young. You cannot

a world of heartache, my little one, to long for something which you
It had been with her ever since Kennon had come into her life that
night a year ago. And it had grown until it had become gigantic. He
was kind--yes. He was harsh--occasionally. Yet he had shown her no more
affection than he would have shown a dog. Less--for he would have petted
the need was that of a builder for a tool. He liked her and sometimes
shared his problems and triumphs with her, and sometimes his defeats,
but he did not love. There had never been for her the bright fierce look
he had bent upon the Woman Eloise those times when she had come to him,
bronze skin, firm chin, soft lips and long straight nose, the
narrowed eyes, hooded beneath thick brows, scanning the papers in his
lean-tendoned hands. His nearness was an ache in her body--yet he was
once, and that touch had burned like hot iron. For hours she had felt
it. He looked up. Her heart choked her with its beating. She would die
for him if he would but once run his fingers over her tingling skin, and
One didn't need Sorovkin techniques to interpret what was in her mind.
And it would have been amusing if it weren't so sad. For what she
wanted, he couldn't give. Yet if she were human it would be easy. A
hundred generations of Betan moral code said "never," yet when he looked
at her their voices faded. He was a man--a member of the ruling race.
She was an animal--a beast--a humanoid--near human but not near enough.
To like her was easy--but to love her was impossible. It would be
bestiality. Yet his body, less discerning than his mind, responded to
not analyze. In a way it was poetry--the fierce, vaguely disquieting
poetry of the sensual Santosian bards--the lyrics that sung of the joys
of flesh. He had never really liked them, yet they filled him with a
vague longing, an odd uneasiness--just the sort that filled him now.

talking about coffee. Banality was at once the curse and the saving

this coffee was a man's drink. She had tried it once but the hot
bitterness scalded her mouth and flooded her body with its heat. And she
had felt so lightheaded. Not like herself at all. It wasn't a drink for
her. Perhaps--yet--she might find favor in his eyes. The hope was always
there within her--a hope that was at once fear and prayer. And if she
hope and pain. Never, he swore, had he saw anything more beautiful or
sad. Involuntarily he placed his hand upon her arm. She flinched, her
muscles tensing under his finger tips. It was though his fingers carried
bath in ice water. Her heart sank. She shivered. She would never find
her desire here. He was cold--cold--cold! He wouldn't see. He didn't
care. All right--so that was how it had to be. But first she would tell
him. Then he could do with her as he wished. "I hoped--for the past year
that you would see me. That you would think of me not as a Lani, but as
a beloved." The words came faster now, tumbling over one another. "That
you would desire me and take me to those worlds we cannot know unless
you humans show us. I have hoped so much, but I suppose it's wrong--for
you--you are so very human, and I--well, I'm not!" The last three words
hands were on her shoulders and the nearness of him drove the breath
from her body. From a distance she heard a hard tight voice that was her
hard bright look that encompassed and possessed her! The curved lips
drawn over white, white teeth! The flared nostrils! The hungry demand
upon his face that answered the demand in her heart! And she knew--at
last--with a knowledge that turned her limbs to water, that she had
meaning! Kennon strode furiously down the dusty road toward Station One
trying to sublimate his inner conflict into action. It was useless, of
course, for once he stopped moving the grim tug-of-war between training
and desire would begin again, and no matter how it ended the result
would be unsatisfactory. As long as he had been able to delude himself
that he was fond of Copper the way a man is fond of some lesser species,
it had been all right. But he knew now that he was fond of her as a man
is of a woman--and it was hell! For no rationalization in the universe
would allow him to define her as human. Copper was humanoid--something
like human. And to live with her and love her would not be
miscegenation, which was bad enough, but bestiality which was a thousand
word, and even bestiality had become a loose definition on many worlds
with humanoid populations, the words had definite meaning and moral
force to a Betan. And--God help him--he was a Betan. A lifetime of
training in a moral code that frowned upon mixed marriages and shrank
appalled from even the thought of mixing species was nothing to bring
what their customs and codes prohibited them from doing to themselves.
For thousands of years--back to the very dawn of history when men had
bred horses and asses to produce mules--men had been mixing species
to produce useful hybrids. Yet a Betan who could hybridize plants or
animals with complete equanimity shrank with horror from the thought of
head angrily. He didn't know. There was no answer. But the idea--the
belief--was there, ingrained into his attitudes, a part of his outlook,
built carefully block by block from infancy until it now towered into a
Beta. In the rest of the Brotherhood, the color of a man's skin, the
shape of his face, the quality and color of his hair and eyes made no
difference. All men were brothers. But on Beta, where a variant-G sun
had already caused genetic divergence, the brotherhood of man was a term
that was merely given lip service. Betans were different and from birth
they were taught to accept the difference and to live with it. Mixing of
Betan stock with other human species, while not actually forbidden, was
so encircled with conditioning that it was a rare Betan indeed who would
risk self-opprobrium and the contempt of his fellows to mate with an
outsider. And as for humanoids--Kennon shuddered. He couldn't break the
the glad light in her eyes, as a burned child flees fire. He needed time
to think, time to plan. Yet his body and his surface thoughts wanted no
plans or time. Living with a Lani wasn't frowned upon on Flora. Many of
the staff did, nor did anyone seem to think less of them for doing
so. Even Alexander himself had half-confessed to a more than platonic
mind that kept repeating sodomite--sodomite--sodomite with a passionless

look like you'd seen a ghost. And out in this sun without a helmet! Come
the curiosity that filled him. "I just had a call from Message Center

there had been no word of him. And now--he laughed a sharp bark of
humorless annoyance--Douglas couldn't have timed it better if he had

which he was grateful. He packed quickly, threw his bags into the jeep,
and took off with almost guilty haste. He'd contact the Hospital from
the Otpens. Right now all he wanted was to put distance between himself
and Copper. Absence might make the heart grow fonder, but at the moment
propinquity was by far the more dangerous thing. He pointed the blunt
nose of the jeep toward Mount Olympus, set the autopilot, opened the
throttle, and relaxed as best he could as the little vehicle sped at top

yellow as Kennon circled the building. He brought the jeep in lightly,

with its domed turrets and ugly snouts of the main battery projectors
pointing skyward. Beside him, the long metal doors of a missile launcher
made a rectangular trace on the smooth surface of the roof. Behind him
the central tower poked its gaunt ferromorph and durilium outline into
the darkening sky bearing its crown of spiderweb radar antennae turning
steadily on their gimbals covering a vast hemisphere from horizon to

his battle dress. His face was harsh, and in his hands he carried a

lowered them to the ground floor. They passed through a gloomy
caricature of the Great Hall in Alexandria, through an iris, and down a
disciplined formation. Steel clanged on steel as they turned the corner
and moments later the whine of servos came faintly to their ears. From
somewhere deep in the pile a rising crescendo of generators under full
battle load sent out vibrations that could be sensed rather than heard.
A klaxon squawked briefly. There was another clash of metal, and a harsh
voice boomed through the corridors. "Fourteen seconds. Well done. Secure

for Kennon to enter. The pastel interior of the modern office was a

and forth as his fingers caressed the knobby grip of a small Burkholtz

between his eyes. He looked older and the indefinable air of cruelty was
more pronounced. He had been frightened the last time Kennon had seen

artificial fertilization has more holes in it than a sieve. That
technique has been investigated a thousand times. And it has never
worked past the first generation. If you had been using it, the Lani
would long ago have been extinct. Haploids don't reproduce, and the only
way the diploid number of chromosomes can be kept is to replace those
lost by maturation division of the ovum. You might be able to keep the
diploid number by using immature ova, but the fertilization technique
would be far more complex than the simple uterine injections you use at

from males. What's more, the males have to be the same species as the
females or fertilization will not take place. So there must be male

of the prisons of early human history where men confined other men for
infractions of social customs. The grimness of the place was appalling.
The male Lani--impressive in their physical development--were in
miserable condition, nauseated, green-faced, retching. The sickening
odors of vomit and diarrhea hung heavily on the air. Douglas coughed and
held a square of cloth to his face, and even Kennon, strong-stomached
as he was, could feel his viscera twitch in sympathy with the caged

most vicious, cunning, and dangerous animals on Kardon. They exist with
on a bare cot, a magnificently muscled figure with a ragged black beard
hiding his face. There were dozens of scars on his body and one angry
purple area on his thick right forearm where flesh had been torn away
not too long ago. Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and soft
moaning noises came from his tight lips as he pressed his abdomen with
too late. Kennon touched the bars, and as he did, the Lani moved with
fluid speed, one huge hand clutching Kennon's sleeve and pulling him
against the bars while the other darted for his throat. Fingers bit
into Kennon's neck and tightened in a viselike grip. Kennon reacted
automatically. His arms came up inside the Lani's and crashed down,
elbows out, tearing the Lani loose. He jumped back, rubbing his bruised
laughter. "He must be sick or he would have killed you. George is clever
was a beastlike note in his voice that made the short hairs on Kennon's
harsh. "All men fear me. All Lani, too. I am boss. Come close again man
life has been based on his ability to survive in an environment where
every male is his enemy. You see here the sublimation of individuality.
He cannot co-operate with another male. He hates them, and they in turn
hate him. George, here, is a perfect example of absolute freedom from
being a male, his mother thought she was favored by the gods and she
denied him nothing. In fact we were quite insistent that she gave him
everything he wanted. By the time he was able to walk and take care of
together." Douglas grinned. "You should see what happens when a dozen
spoiled brats are forced to live together. It's more fun. The little
beasts hate each other on sight. And we stimulate them to compete for
toys, food, and drink. Never quite enough to go around. You can imagine
what happens. Instead of sharing, each little selfish individualist
fights to get everything he can grab. Except for one thing we
don't punish them no matter what they do. If anyone shows signs of
co-operating he is disciplined severely, the first time. The next time,
he is culled. But other than that, we leave them alone. They develop
their personalities and their muscles--and if one proves to be too
much for his fellows we transfer him to a more advanced class where the

more mature than either you or I. He has all the answers he needs. He's

resents encroachment. He's a complete individualist. If he proves out he

We merely take advantage of natural impulses to produce a better

the noble savage, natural selection and survival of the fittest. He
thought it was great--said there was nothing like relentless competition
to bring out the strongest and hardiest types. And he's been right for
centuries. Can you imagine anything much better than George--from a
something bigger and more powerful than the male himself. And that would
modify the results. We can control them well enough with knockout gas
and shackles. And those things, oddly enough, don't destroy their pride
or self-esteem. They think that we use them because we are afraid, and

humanoid glared back, his eyes bright with hatred. Kennon felt the
short hairs prickle along the back of his neck. George roused a primal
emotion--an elemental dislike that was deeper than reason--an antagonism
intensely physical, almost overpowering--a purely adrenal response that
encountered George. But if George was a typical male--then the Lani were
alien. He flexed his muscles and stared coldly into the burning blue
eyes behind the bars. There would be considerable satisfaction in
beating this monstrosity to a quivering pulp. Millennia of human
pre-eminence--of belief that nothing, no matter how big or muscular,
should fail to recognize that a man's person was inviolate--fed the
fuel of his anger. The most ferocious beasts on ten thousand worlds
had learned this lesson. And yet this animal had laid hands on him
with intent to kill. A cold corner of his mind kept telling him that he
wasn't behaving rationally, but he disregarded it. George was a walking

with such force that Kennon was slammed against the wall, dazed--half
stunned by the speed of the attack. George--he had time to think in one
brief flash--wasn't stupid. He had held his breath for the necessary two
George dropped and rolled. The sizzling streak of violet flashed inches
above his body and tore a six-inch hole through the back of the cell.
And then George was on him! The huge, marvelously fast hands of the
humanoid wrenched the blaster out of Douglas's hands and jerked him
forward. A scream burst from Douglas as George's hands closed around his
neck. Muscles sprang into writhing life in the humanoid's huge forearms.
There was a soft, brittle crack, and Douglas sagged limp in the iron
back and came out into the passageway. "Maybe you make better fight,"
George said as he lowered his head into the muscular mass of his broad
arms held slightly forward. Kennon backed away, watching the humanoid's
eyes for that telltale flicker of the pupils that gives warning
of attack. The expression on George's face never changed. It was
satisfied--smug almost--reflecting the feelings of a brute conditioned
met an opponent like this. A chill raced up the back of his legs and
spread over his stomach and chest. His mouth was dry and his muscles
quivered with tense anticipation. But his concentration never wavered.
His hard blue eyes never left George's, searching with microscopic
snarl of rage and hate. But even as he charged Kennon moved. He ducked
beneath the Lani's outstretched hands and drove his left fist deep into
power of the blow. Kennon clipped him on the chin with a driving knee,
snapping George's head back and smashed the bearded face with the
shackles. Blood spurted and George screamed with rage. One of the Lani's
big hands wrapped around the shackles and tugged. Kennon let go and
handcuff rings scraped across Kennon's cheek, but did nothing more
than break the skin. Half paralyzed by the blows to his solar plexus,
George's co-ordination was badly impaired. But he kept trying. Kennon
wrapped lean fingers about one of George's outstretched hands, bent,
pivoted, and slammed the Lani with bone-crushing force against the bars
of a nearby cell. But George didn't go down. "He's more brute than man,"
Kennon thought. "No man could take a beating like that!" He moved aside
from George's stumbling rush, feeling a twinge of pity for the battered
humanoid. It was no contest. Strong as he was, George didn't know the
rudiments of hand-to-hand fighting. His reactions were those of an
animal, to close, clutch, bite, and tear. Even if he were completely
well, the results would have been the same. It would merely have taken
longer. Kennon drove a vicious judo chop to the junction of the Lani's
neck and shoulder. Brute strength was no match for the highly evolved
mayhem that every spaceman learns as a necessary part of his trade.
George had never been on planet leave in a spaceport town. He knew
nothing about the dives, the crimps, the hostile port police. His idea
of fighting was that of a beast, but Kennon was a civilized man to whom
fighting was an art perfected by millennia of warfare. And Kennon knew
George was strong, and George had courage and pride that kept him coming
as long as the blazing will behind his blazing eyes could drive his
mark. It was hardly more than a scratch, but it had been close. George
had his lesson and Kennon felt oddly degraded. He sighed, dragged George

his waist belt and spoke rapidly into it. "Arleson in stud cell block,"
he said. "Attempted escape. One casualty--Douglas Alexander--yes,

respect in his hard brown eyes. "You did that!--to him! Man, you're a

raid on this place about fifty years ago. Seems as though one of our
competitors didn't like us. Alexandria was on a war footing then and
managed to hold them off. But it scared the Old Man. You see, our
competitive position is based on Lani labor. Our competitors didn't know
that. Their intelligence wasn't so good. Up until that time, we'd been
keeping the males out here in what was hardly more than a stockade.
Those people could have taken a few dozen females and a couple of males
and they'd have been in business. But they didn't know. They tried to
smash Alexandria instead. Naturally they didn't have a chance. And after
it was over the Old Man got smart. He still had the tapes for Alexandria
so he built a duplicate out here and spent a few millions on modern

them enough long-term good to pay for the force they'd need to be
the best male is a dangerous beast. They have a flair for violence that
makes them useless as labor and their training doesn't help matters.
And the other is mental. The females on the main island believe that we

to keep them in line. We have a great deal more trouble with them out
here once they know the truth. We've had a number of cases of females
trying to engineer a male's escape. But they're never repeated," Mullins
said grimly. "Actually, it would be an interesting life out here, except

place and back to the main island. He wanted to see Copper. He'd be
damned if anyone was going to butcher her. If he had to stay here until
patients as he did toward the Lani, or if they ultimately lost their
individuality and became mere hosts for diseases, parasites,
and tumors--vehicles for the practice of surgical and medical
skills--economic units whose well-being meant a certain amount of
credits. Probably not, he decided. They were human and their very
animal medicine where economics was the main factor and the satisfaction
of the owner the principal personality problem. The normal farm animals,
the shrakes, cattle, sheep, morks, and swine were no problem. They were
merely a job. But the Lani were different. They weren't human, but they
were intelligent and they did have personality even though they didn't
possess that indefinable quality that separated man from the beasts. It
was hard to treat them with dispassionate objectivity. In fact, it was
right to identify them as individuals and treat them as persons
rather than things? The passing months had failed to rob them of their
personalities: they had not become the faceless mass of a herd of cattle
or a flock of sheep. They were still not essentially different
from humans--and wouldn't men themselves lose many of their human
characteristics if they were herded into barracks and treated as
property for forty generations? Wouldn't men, too, approach the animal
condition if they were bred and treated as beasts, their pedigrees
if he were so busy he could drop to his bed exhausted each night and
sleep without dreaming, if he could keep on the run so fast that he
wouldn't have time to sit and reflect. But he had done his work too
well. He had trained his staff too thoroughly. They could handle the
petty routines of minor treatment and laboratory tests as well as he. He
had only the intellectual stimulation of atypical cases and these were
all too rare. The routine inspections were boring, yet he forced himself
to make them because they filled the time. The hospital wards were
virtually empty of patients, the work was up to date, the whole island
was enjoying a carnival of health, and Kennon was still impaled upon
the horns of his dilemma. It wasn't so bad now that the first shock was
over, but it was bad enough--and showed no signs of getting better. Now
that Copper realized he wanted her, she did nothing to make his life
easier. Instead she did her best to get underfoot, usually in some
provocative position. It was enough to try the patience of a marble
statue Kennon reflected grimly. But it did have its humorous side
and were it not for the fact that Copper wasn't human could have
been thoroughly enjoyable. That, however, was the real hell of it. He
couldn't relax and enjoy the contest--his feet were on too slippery
ground. And Copper with her unerring female instinct knew just what to
do to make the footing slipperier. Sooner or later, she was certain that
he would fall. It was only a question of applying sufficient pressure at
the right spot and the right time. Now that she knew he desired her,
she was content to wait. The only thing that had bothered her was the
uncertainty whether he cared or not. For Copper the future was a simple
thing and she was lighthearted about it. But not so Kennon. Even after
the initial shock had passed there still remained the moral customs, the
conditioning, and the prohibitions. But Copper--was Copper--and somehow
the conditioning lost its force in her presence. Perhaps, he thought
wryly, it was a symptom of the gradual erosion of his moral character in
turning the pages of the Kardon Journal of Allied Medical Sciences.

head to one side. From this angle Copper looked decidedly intriguing as

impulse to slap as she went past, and congratulated himself on his
self-control as she looked at him with a half-disappointed expression
on her face. She had expected it, he thought gleefully. Score one for

Copper unpacked the lunch. She moved slowly. After all, there was plenty

of Beta, did not end abruptly at a snow line, but pushed green fingers
upward through passages between old lava flows, on whose black wrinkled
surfaces nothing grew. The faint hum of insects and the piping calls of
the birdlike mammals added to the impression of remoteness. It was hard

black wails closed in, narrowing until only a slit of yellow sky was
visible overhead. The path underfoot was surprisingly smooth and free
from rocks, but the narrow corridor, steeped in shadows, was gloomy and
depressingly silent. It even bothered Kennon, although he wouldn't
admit it. What forces had sliced this razor-thin cleft in the dense
rock around them? Earthquake probably. And if it happened once it could
happen again. He would hate to be trapped here entombed in shattered
volcanic ash dotted with sputter cones opened before them. It was a
flat tableland, roughly circular, scarcely half a kilometer across,
a desolation of black rock, stunted trees and underbrush, and gray
volcanic ash. A crater, somewhat larger than the rest, lay with its
nearest edge about two hundred meters away. The rock edges were fire
polished, gleaming in the yellow sunshine, and the thin margin of trees
and brush surrounding the depression were gnarled and shrunken, twisted
like a meteor had struck here--but those stunted plants--hmm--there

Your ancestors could have picked this up from Alexander's men. They came
the origin of our world, even before Ulf and Lyssa. It is the first
Book--the Book of the God-spell. Man Alexander came in the sixth
where she had left off. And Kennon learned the Lani version of creation,
of the first man and woman, cast out of Heaven for loving each other
despite the Master's objection, of how they came to Flora and founded
the race of the Lani. He learned how the Lani grew in numbers and power,
how they split into two warring groups over the theological point of
whether Ulf or Lyssa was the principal deity, how Roga the Foolish
opened Lyssa's tower to find out whether the Ulfians or Lyssans were
of Ulf and the priests of Lyssa--united by this greatest sacrilege. And
he heard the Lani version of the landing of Alexander's ship and man's
of bravery and cowardice, of love and beauty. Yet through it all, even
through the redes that described the Conquest, there was a curious
remoteness, a lack of emotion that made the verses more terrible as they

she said, "but it's all about our lives since the Man Alexander--the old
one--took possession of us. And most of the newer redes are pretty dull.
Our life hasn't changed much since the men came. The Book of Man is
boring." Copper sighed. "I have dared a great deal by telling you these

he wasn't a Betan. If, if, if. Resentment gorged his throat. It was
unfair--so damned unfair. He had no business coming here. He should have
stayed on Beta or at least on a human world where he would never have
met Copper. He loved her, but he couldn't have her. It was Tantalus and
Sisyphus rolled into one unsightly package and fastened to his
soul. With a muttered curse he rose to his feet, and as he did he

looked completely ordinary. Kennon was amazed at the perfection of the
natural camouflage. The Pit was merely another crater in the pitted
ground. He dropped to a lower altitude, barely a hundred feet above the
bluish-black hemisphere protruded from the crater floor. It would have
passed unnoticed by the casual eye--nearly concealed by two gigantic

roentgen per hour as he thrust the probe over the rim of the depression.

for quite a while even without suits." He lowered himself over the edge,

debris and ash that had fallen or blown into the pit during the
centuries it had rested there. It was old--incredibly old. The hull
design was ancient--riveted sheets of millimeter-thick durilium. Ships
hadn't been built like that in over two thousand years. And the ovoid
shape was reminiscent of the even more ancient spindizzy design. A
hyperspace converter like that couldn't be less than four millennia
old. It was a museum piece, but the blue-black hull was as smooth and
reflected. For five thousand years men had used the incredibly tough
synthetic to build their spacecraft. It had given man his empire. Kennon
gave the hull one quick glance. That part of the ship didn't worry him.
It was what he would find inside that bothered him. How much damage had
occurred from two thousand or more years of disuse? How much had the
original travelers cannibalized? How much could be salvaged? What sort
of records remained? There were a thousand questions that the interior

a repository as well as he did. But in the meantime there would be

enough to make the port visible, and the ash was not yet cleared away
sufficiently to open the portal when darkness brought a halt to the

all right, by careful handling it should be possible to use the drive to

work and call it a day. A few branches and the big blocks of pumice
would suffice for temporary camouflage. Later they could make something
better. Anything in the jeep which might be useful was cached along with
the radiation suits in the passageway through the lava wall--and in a

questions. He looked ahead into the gathering night. The gray mass of
the abandoned Olympus Station slipped below them as he lined the jeep

set the controls on automatic, and locked the craft on the guide beacon

human. The spaceship and the redes proved it as far as he was concerned.
But moral certainty and legal certainty were two different things. What
he believed might be good enough to hold up in a Brotherhood court, but
he doubted it. Ulf and Lyssa might be the founders of the Lani race, but
they had come to Kardon nearly four thousand years ago and no records
existed to prove that the Lani weren't here before they came. Redes
passed by word of mouth through hundreds of generations were not
evidence. Even the spaceship wasn't the absolute proof that would be
needed to overturn the earlier legal decision. Other and better
proof was needed--something that would stand up in any court in the

find inside that hull. Every step of the work must be documented beyond
any refutation. Some method of establishing date, time, and location had
to be prepared. There must be a record of every action. And that would
require equipment and planning. There must be no mistake that could be
prestige were involved. To prove the Lani human would destroy Outworld
Enterprises on Kardon. Yet this thought did not bother him. To his
surprise he had no qualms of conscience. He was perfectly willing to
violate his contract, break faith with his employers, and plot their
desires that leavened the nobility. To prove Copper human was enough
motivation--actually it was better than his sense of duty. Events,
Kennon reflected, cause a great deal of change in one's attitude.
Although not by nature a plotter, schemes had been flitting through his
mind with machinelike regularity, to be examined and discarded, or to be
on personalities, and had too little chance for success. He considered
the possibility of letters to the Brotherhood Council but ultimately
rejected it. Not only was the proof legally insufficient to establish
humanity in the Lani, but he also remembered Alexander's incredible
knowledge of his activities, and there was no reason to suppose that
his present didn't receive the same scrutiny as the past. And if he,
who hadn't written a letter in over a year, suddenly began to write, the
correspondence would undoubtedly be regarded with suspicion and would
probably be examined, and Dirac messages would be out for the same
could inform the Brotherhood. Leaving Flora wouldn't be particularly
difficult, but leaving Kardon would be virtually impossible. His
contract called for vacations, but it expressly provided that they would
be taken on Kardon. And again, there would be no assurance that his
activities would not be watched. In fact, it was probable that they
long-range measures that could be started. He could begin preparing a
case that could be presented to the Council. And Beta, when it knew,
would help him. The situation of the Lani was so close to Beta's own
that its obvious merit as a test case simply could not be ignored. If
he could get the evidence to Beta, it would be easy to enlist the aid
of the entire Medico-Technological Civilization. It would take time and
attention to detail; the case, the evidence, everything would have to
be prepared with every safeguard and contingency provided, so that there
transport it under its own power. The thought intrigued him. Actually it
wouldn't be too difficult. Externally the Egg wasn't in bad shape. The
virtually indestructible durilium hull was still intact. The controls
and the engines, hermetically sealed inside the hull, were probably as
good as the day they stopped running. The circuitry would undoubtedly be
bad but it could be repaired and restored, and new fuel slugs could be
obtained for the engine and the converter. But that was a problem for
cameras and recorders, the entrance port of the God-Egg swung open and
revealed the dark interior. Kennon moved carefully, recording every step
as he entered the black orifice in the spaceship's side. His handtorch
gave plenty of light for the recorders as he moved inside--Copper at his

Wanderer with the date of launching and a lower line which read "Ship's
Log." Kennon was thankful for his medical training. The four years
of Classical English that he had despised so much were essential now.
Stumbling over unfamiliar words and phrases, he moved slowly through
the log tracing the old ship's history from pleasure craft to short-haul
freight tractor to obsolescence in a space dump orbiting around a world
obsolete during the Interregnum. I had to learn it, since most medical
one came after the Second Galactic War--but never mind that--it happened
long ago and isn't important now. The important thing that did happen
beyond the next star. During that century men traveled wider and farther
then they ever have before or since. In that outward explosion with
its mixed motivations of religion and practicality, colonists and
missionaries went starward to find new worlds to tame, and new races to
be rescued from the darkness of idolatry and hell. Almost any sort
of vehicle capable of mounting a spindizzy converter was pressed into
service. The old spindizzies were soundly engineered converters of
almost childlike simplicity that could and did carry ships enormous
distances if their passengers didn't care about subjective time-lag, and
bought by Alfred and Melissa Weygand--a missionary couple with the idea
explosion that scattered human seed across parsecs of interstellar
space. It seems that they were a unit in a missionary fleet that had
gone out to the stars with flame in their hearts and Gospel on their
lips to bring the Word to the benighted heathen on other worlds."
Kennon's lips curled with mild contempt at their stupid foolhardiness
even as his pulse quickened to their bravery. They had been fanatics,
true enough, but theirs was a selfless fanaticism that would risk
torture and death for what they believed--a fanaticism that was more
sublime than the concept of Brotherhood which had evolved from it. They
knew nothing of the enmity of race, of the incessant struggle man
had since waged with alien intelligences all too willing to destroy
intruders who encroached upon their worlds. Mankind's early selflessness
had long ago been discarded for frank expansionism and dominance over
story that was more than the bare bones of flight. There was passion
and tenderness and a spiritual quality that was shocking to a modern
man steeped in millennia of conquest and self-interest. There was a
greatness to it, a depth of faith that had since been lost. And as
Kennon slowly deciphered the ancient script he admired the courage even
in hyperspace, doubling and twisting upon their course until they had
become hopelessly lost, and then, with their fuel nearly exhausted, had
broken out into the normal three-space continuum to find Kardon's sun
before their fuel was exhausted. And it was only by further grace that
the planet was habitable and not populated with intelligent life. They
had more luck than people were entitled to in a dozen lifetimes. Against
buildings--no sign of intelligent life. We are lost, marooned on this
empty world. Our fuel supplies are too low for us to attempt to find the
others. Nor could we. The constellations in the sky are strange. We do
not know which way to go. Therefore we shall land upon the great island
in the center of the yellow sea. And perhaps someday men will come to us
since we cannot return to them. Melissa thinks that this is an example
of Divine Providence, that the Lord's mercy has been shown to us that
were lost in the vastness of the deep--that we have been chosen, like
Eve and Adam, to spread the seed of man to yet another world. I hope
she is right, yet I fear the radiation level of the ship has become
inordinately high. We may well be Eve and Adam, yet an Adam that cannot
beget and an Eve that is not fruitful. I am trimming the ship for
landing, and we shall leave it immediately after we have landed, taking
with us only what we absolutely need. There is too much radiation from
the spindizzy and the drive to remain here longer--and God knows how hot
But not proof. Lawyers could argue that since no direct exploration was
made there was no valid reason to assume that the Lani did not already
inhabit Kardon. But Kennon knew. His body, more perceptive than his
mind, had realized a truth that his brain would not accept until he read
the log. It was at once joy and frustration. Joy that Copper was human,
frustration that he could not obtain for her and her race the rights
to which they were entitled. But the immediate problem was solved. His
conditioning was broken now he was convinced that Copper was a member
of the human race. It was no violation of his code to love her. The
greatest barrier was broken, and with it gone the lesser ones would
yield. Relief that was almost pain washed through him and left him weak
book, yet you turn to me with the look in your eyes that the redes say
probably very little about the injustice of her present. The thing that
mattered was that what had kept them apart was gone. She was probably
offering mental sacrifices to the Old Ones who had caused this change
in the man she loved. She didn't really care about what had caused the
apparently was for her. The fact that Copper was human posed a greater
problem than the one it solved. The one had been personal. The other was
infinitely greater. He could not let it lie. The very morality which had
kept him from doing what he wished when he thought she was a humanoid
now forced him to do what he did not wish. Every instinct said to leave
it alone. The problem was too great for one man to solve, the situation
too complicated, the evidence too inconclusive, the opposition too
powerful. It would be far better to take his happiness and enjoy it.
It was not his problem to solve. He could turn the evidence over to
the Brotherhood once his contract was over, and better and more capable
people than he could settle the Lani legal status. But the inner voice
that had called him bestial now called him shirker, coward, and slacker.
And this, too, could not be borne. The case of the Lani would have to
be pursued as vigorously as he could do it. They were entitled to human
decided as they finished the inspection of the ship. Even if it was
never used it would make a good means of retreat. He grinned wryly. In a
guerrilla operation such as the one he was considering it would be wise
to have a way out if things got too hot. The heavy parts, the engines
and the controls, were in workable condition and would merely require
cleaning and oiling. Some of the optical equipment would have to be
replaced and fuel slugs would have to be obtained for the drive--but
none of these would be too hard to accomplish. The slugs from any of the
power reactors on the island would serve nicely. All that would have
to be done would be to modify the fuel ports on the ship's engine. The
spindizzy would have to be disassembled and checked, and the main leads,
embedded in time-resistant plastic, would have to be examined. The most
serious problem, however, wouldn't involve these things. The control
board wiring and circuitry was where the trouble would lie. Normal
insulation and printed circuitry wasn't designed to last for thousands
of years. Each wired circuit would have to be removed, duplicated, and
replaced. Every printed panel would have to be cleaned and receive a new
coat of insulating varnish. Working full time, a four-man electronics
team could do the job in a week. Working part-time the two of them might
get it done in three months. And the other jobs would take at least
another. Add a month for errors in judgment, lack of materials, and
mistakes--and another for unavoidable delays--it would be at least six
any mistakes. He would have to be careful, yet he must not give the
impression of being careful. He shook his head. Being a subversive was
going to require a greater amount of acting ability than he had ever

convinced she was human. She was not. And until her mind could be
changed on that point she would help him but her heart wouldn't be in
it. And the only thing that would convince her that she was human would
be a child--a child of his begetting. He could perhaps trick her with
an artificial insemination of Lani sperm. There were drugs that could
suspend consciousness, hypnotics that would make her believe anything
actions were examined under psychoprobe, and a hypnotic was of no value
against a lie detector that could extract the deepest buried truth.
And he would be examined too. The truth would out--and nothing would be
gained. In fact--everything would be lost. The attempt at trickery would
prejudice any court against the honest evidence they had so painfully
the evidence would hold. With Betan legal talent at their back it
might. And, of course, they could try to produce a child as nature had
intended. They could try--but Kennon knew it would not succeed. It never

on the bathroom door. She pivoted slowly before the glass, eying herself
critically, raising her arms over her head, holding them at her sides,
flexing her supple spine and tightening muscles that moved like silken

which occasionally occurred in humans and animals. The brain, desiring
children, made demands upon the body and the body responded to its
desire by tricking the brain. Lani were fairly subject to it probably
because they had better imaginations. He would run a few tests when they
went down to the hospital, and once she realized the practical joke her
body was playing everything would be all right. No wonder she seemed

stand against a fraction of the power Alexander could mount against you.

All of these weapons Alexander can command. Don't you realize he's an

and by then everybody will know about you. Someone will certainly check

come to light. The Egg will be destroyed. I will be erased. You will be
dead. And that will be the end of it." He looked down at her with an odd

wanted you before you looked on me. I still do and I do not feel at

rivulets of tears, and bitterness galled his throat. Dear God--let her

was the proof he needed. The final test that would prove the Lani human.
And he had no way of getting it where it would do any good. It would
take at least four months of steady labor before the ship was ready, and
he didn't have that sort of time. He was needed here and his prolonged
absence would cause suspicion and investigation. Something would have to
be done--but what? He couldn't take Copper off the island in an airboat.
They were checked with microscopic care by Otpen One's IFF. A jeep
didn't have enough range to take them to the mainland. And even if they
got there they couldn't get off the planet. Alexander knew everything
that happened on Kardon's two spaceports. The Egg was the only way, but
wouldn't work. It would be impossible, to hide a baby on a place where
every birth was recorded. Nor could one hide evidence of pregnancy in a
Lani. Childbearing leaves telltale marks upon the body, and Copper, even
if she could be concealed for the duration of her pregnancy, could never
survive the sharp-eyed scrutiny of her fellows or the other humans.
strange how so little a thing as the union of a spermatozoon and an ovum
could produce so much trouble. He looked across the office at Copper
placidly filing case cards. She wasn't worrying. With sublime faith,
she was sure that he would find the answer, the one that would solve
everything. He shuddered. The only logical solution was abortion--and
that was unthinkable! He would not murder his child--nor would Copper
he grinned feebly. Alexander didn't know. He couldn't know. It had to be
The location was different--the conference room in Alexandria was more
formal than Blalok's parlor but the same people were present: Alexander,
Blalok, Jordan, and himself. Somehow Alexander seemed to have shrunk. He
was no longer as impressive as he had been. But the man still radiated
force, even though it didn't seem quite so overpowering. The year,
Kennon thought, had done much to build his self-confidence. He felt
success is due to co-operation from the operating staff. And that's
Blalok's doing--he knocked the heads of the division managers together
and they took care of their staffs. Otherwise we could have had a bad
admiration society. I called you because I want to expand the Lani
at the head of the table. "There's going to be no selling. The Lani are
too valuable for that. We'll need them more than the money they'd bring
on the market. You see--I've acquired a planet out on the periphery. A
place called Phoebe. One of our ships found it, and I staked a discovery
claim on the major land mass, and the crew made lesser claims that
covered all the available land. Last month the Brotherhood allowed the
claims. Last week the crewmen sold me their land. Phoebe's a lovely
place--quite a bit like Flora--and the ecological tests show it's
capable of supporting mammalian life. Just before I came here I sent
three shiploads of exterminators to clean it up and make it ready for
difference," he said. "But it could have. The Lani are sensitive to
things like that. If they thought that they were walking in over a pile
of bodies they'd do badly. It'd be like Olympus all over again. And we
couldn't keep them from knowing. We talk and we forget, but they'd tell
domes--but why do you?--oh! I see! I hadn't considered that point."
Alexander's hand darted to the phone beside him. "Get me Albertsville,"
he snapped. "Yes, my offices--I want Mr. Oliver in purchasing and
contracting. Hello--Ward? Alexander here. Yes--everything's fine. I
have a job for you--use your scrambler-pattern two." Alexander
dialed the scrambler code on the second dial at the base of the phone,
effectively preventing eavesdropping by beam tappers. "Yes," he went on.
"It's Project Phoebe. Have you secured title to the moons? You haven't?
Well--you'd better do it before some of our competitors get bright
ideas. Sure they know about the project--do you think they're stupid?
Warren over at Consolidated practically told me that he was onto our
scheme. So get title to those moons. Since they're uninhabitable and
within the planet's primary field they come under the Spatial Debris Act
and you should be able to get Kardonian title without any great amount
of trouble. Naturally we want them.--For defense--what else? We'll have
most of our eggs in that basket. No--I don't know how we overlooked that
point. But if it wasn't for a bright young man out here we'd have left
ourselves wide open. Now get cracking--get that leak plugged!" Alexander
dropped the phone back in its cradle and sighed. "Well--that's buttoned
shattering certainty exploded in his mind--Alexander was a telepath!
That was his difference! That was the thing that made him feared and
respected by his business associates. It wouldn't have been enough on
the Central Worlds, where men knew of sensitives and took precautions
correctly." From somewhere deep in his memory an old quip came floating
to the surface: "An executive is a man who picks brains--others'
brains." By that definition Alexander was an executive of the first
thinking about? Had he thought of--two times two are four, four times
four are sixteen, sixteen times sixteen are--let's see, six times
sixteen is ninety-six, one times sixteen is--six, five, carry
contract, and you wrote a Peeper Clause into it. And then you peep in
the worst way possible. There's no defense against a Telep unless
you know about him; you've had my whole mind bare! You've violated my
personal privacy like no man has done before. Sure I'm mad. I expected
honesty from you--and you peep!" The anger was stronger now--a wave of
raw emotion based on a lifetime of training in mutual respect of a man's
privacy--a feeling intensified by his childhood environment of a crowded
planetary ecology and the cramped crew quarters on a spaceship. To
bookcase behind Alexander was a thing of beauty. Alexander liked beauty.
He had said so, and the Great Hall below them bore it out. It was a
lovely room. Those four bronze Lani in the fountain were works of art.
One of them looked remarkably like Copper. Copper in bronze. The little
witch had probably posed for the casting. Maybe it had even been made

bad that--Kennon jerked his attention to Alexander's face. He detested
the thought that his mind was common property. A man should have
something he can call his own. There had been a clinics instructor
in Year Six who was a sensitive. The classes had protected themselves
against his prying with a circlet--a thought screen--he had done it too.
Maybe he had brought the circlet with him. If he did, no one was going
to catch him without it. It was a dirty business, this reading of
others' thought. Now where had he put that circlet? Was it among his old

to conceal something. There was an undertone of fear--and something
circlet sandwiched between two books on comparative neuroanatomy which
he hadn't bothered to unpack. He slipped it on and connected the lead
wires to a portable battery pack. There was a half-forgotten tingling
as the weak field heterodyned his thought waves. Kennon sighed. If
Alexander wasn't suspicious of him now the man was a fool. He'd done as
well as he could with confusion and outrage, but it was hardly possible
to hide behind superficialities. Even the most disciplined mind couldn't
do that without some preparation. Undoubtedly his concern about Copper
had leaked through. He could only hope that other and more important
doubly careful from now on. He couldn't make daily trips to Olympus. His
reaction had killed that plan. Alexander would be suspicious now--and
unusual actions would crystallize suspicion to certainty. Now he needed
a reason to be in that area. And then he grinned. He had a reason--a
good one--one that would fit in with Alexander's plans and his own.
The only problem would be to make Alexander buy it--and that might be
difficult. He'd have to work carefully--but with normal luck he could
put the idea across. He crossed his fingers as he trudged back up the
things--which was a tribute to Alexander's ability to keep the subject
in hand. Details of the expansion program presented by Alexander were
rapidly reduced to workable plans. They involved some rearrangement of
existing facilities, and the construction of others. But the obvious
snags were rapidly disposed of, and the whole revamped operation was
outlined on paper in surprisingly few hours. A deadline date was set,
construction was authorized, and in the morning the first steps in the
Olympus Station. I've often wondered why that particular location has
been so difficult to operate. Sure, I know the accepted explanation,
but I think we should learn why it works and how to break a tabu. If we

merely leading him on. There were too many intangibles, and there was no
excuse. There was plenty of work to do if he was going to prepare an
adequate plan for utilizing Olympus Station. Jordan went with him,
but Blalok stayed behind. It was natural enough. Blalok was the
administrator, but Kennon felt uneasy. Nor would he have felt any better

It was odd, he thought, how one thing led to another and produced an
end that could not be foreseen. Now he could lie and dissemble with the
best. He had no compunction about falsifying a requisition, or stealing
what he could not obtain with apparent honesty. His character had sunk
to an all-time low, he reflected with grim humor as he walked into the
shadow of the main building. Neither Blalok's nor Jordan's frequent
visits bothered him. Both men were creatures of habit and both were
married. They stayed home at night--and it was nighttime that he worked
on the spacer. The project afforded him a perfect cover and it was only
impossible if it wasn't for Copper. Her quick fingers, keen eyesight,
and uncanny memory made the work seem simple, and neither the
tediousness of repairing miles of circuitry nor the depressing
environment of Olympus Station seemed to bother her. While he worked
with the men on the project she restored and reassembled circuits in
his quarters and at night they replaced them in the old ship. And the
the rest. Olympus didn't bother her at all. In fact she seemed to thrive
on the depressing atmosphere that filled the Station. Perhaps it was
because she had violated the tabu about the God-Egg so often that
ordinary superstition had no effect upon her. He shrugged. He had
troubles enough without worrying about Copper's motivations, and not the
too much about the ancient spacer that was strange--and too much that
spindizzy converter that might possibly take her up as high as middle
yellow Cth--far enough to give her a good turn of speed, but not enough
to compensate for timelag. Her screens were monstrosities, double
polyphase lattices that looked about as spacetight as so many sieves.
There were no acceleration dampers, no temporal compensators, no
autopilot, no four-space computer, and the primaries operated on nuclear
rather than binding energy. The control chairs weren't equipped with
forcefields, but instead had incredibly primitive safety webs that held
one in place by sheer tensile strength. Taking a ship like that into
space was an open invitation to suicide. A man needed a combination of
foolhardy bravery and incredible fatalism to blast off in a can like
this. He had the stimulus, but the knowledge of what he would face
troubled him more than he cared to admit. More and more, as he
understood the ship, he was amazed at the courage of the ancients who
had blithely leaped into hyperspace in these flying coffins with no more
motivation than to see what was beyond the nearest star. And in ships
more primitive than this men had swept through the star systems nearest

to himself. "Cousin Alex was right as usual." He grimaced unpleasantly.
"He's up to something--that's for sure." His face twisted into an
expression that was half sneer, half triumph. "This is going to be
fun." He moved the control, and his airboat, hovering silently at five
thousand meters, dropped toward the ground in free fall as Douglas
loosened the Burkholtz in the holster at his waist. "But what is he
doing?" he muttered. The question hung unanswered in the still air of
action. Normally he might have been, but his fear of his cousin was
greater than his respect for Blalok. The superintendent had only
succeeded in accomplishing something he had not intended when he had
tried to dissuade Douglas from visiting Kennon. He had made Douglas
cautious. The airboat and long-range surveillance had been the result.
For the past two nights Douglas had hung over Olympus Station, checking
the place--to leave at dawn when the new day's work began. For two
nights Kennon had been lucky. He had departed for the Egg shortly before
Douglas took up his station, and had returned after the watcher had
called it a night and had returned home. But this last night, Kennon

third of her--anger that she obeyed--anger at his own impotence and
frustration. It wasn't a clean anger. It was a dark, red-splashed thing
that struggled and writhed inside him, a fierce unreasoning rage that
seethed and bubbled yet could not break free. For an instant, with
blinding clarity, Kennon understood the feelings of the caged male Lani

closed over the smooth plastic. Cautiously he turned on the beam and

shadow almost invisible in the starlight. The leaning figure of Douglas
collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been suddenly released. The
torch dropped from his hand and went bouncing and winking down the wall

rotated grotesquely as he disappeared down the slope. Starlight gleamed

Douglas had taken a moment before. He found him sitting on a pile of
of humans named Alfred and Melissa Weygand. They were Christian
missionaries from a planet called Heaven out in Ophiuchus Sector. Went
out to convert aliens and landed here when their fuel ran out."
Kennon paused. "That was about four millennia ago. Their descendants,
naturally, reverted to barbarism in a few generations, but there's
enough evidence in the ship to prove that the Lani were their
too choosy about how they scattered radiation. And they had come a long
way." He paused, looking down at Douglas, feeling a twinge of pity for
the man. His world was crumbling. "And there was no other human blood

Lani all my life. And I know that they're not human. No self-respecting
Lani unless he separated the sexes. And since women are more subjective
in their outlook--and more pliable--he picked them for his slaves. The
males he retired to stud. Probably the fact that there were more women

former. They're cowards: the timid, the unsacrificing--the ones that

Those were the ones who hid rather than risk their lives fighting
the aggressor. Those were the ones who survived. Old Alexander had a
ready-made slave cadre when he finished off the last of the warriors.
For four centuries the survivors have been bred and selected to
perpetuate slave traits. And the system works. The men don't want
freedom--they want liberty to kill each other. The women don't want
freedom--they want males. And they'd serve them precisely as the Sarkian

Below them a soft, barely audible whine ascended the sonic scale to
a point of irritating inaudibility. Kennon smiled. The spindizzy was
functioning properly. He flipped a second bank of switches and a dull
roar came from the buried stem. Ashes and pumice heated to incandescence
were blown through the air. Molten drops of radioactive lava skittered
across the durilium hull as Kennon advanced the power. The whole stem
of the ship was immersed in a seething lake of bolling rock as the Egg
and the Egg shimmered and vanished with a peculiar wrenching motion
into an impossible direction that the mind could not grasp. And the
interceptor missile from Otpen One nosed through the space the Egg had
board, shifting oddly in the harsh yellow monochromatic light that
pervaded the cabin. The screens were leaking like sieves, but they were
holding well enough to keep Cth yellow from being anything more than an
annoyance. He glanced over at Copper, a fantastically elongated Copper

emerged clutching at a gelid mass of air that flowed sluggishly around

distorted Cth environment seeped into the ship turning prosaic shapes
of controls and instruments into writhing masses of obscene horror that
sent extensions wiggling off into nothingness at eye-aching angles. A

until the monster beside her touched her with Kennon's hands. Then,
objective years were passing outside as they hurtled through four-space.
Subjectively it would only be hours aboard the Egg, but a decade--or
maybe a century--might pass outside this mad universe where neither time
nor speed had meaning. The old ships didn't have temporal compensators,
nor could they travel through upper bands of Cth where subjective
and objective time were more nearly equal. They were trapped in
a semi-stasis of time as the ship fled on through the distorted

He had neither the power nor the prestige to request a Brotherhood Board

hope it would pass. If worst came to worst he'd use his rank, but he'd
made enough stir already. He doubted if the Captain had authority to
order him into Detention--but he was certain to get a lecture. These
minor officials loved to tell someone off. He gritted his teeth. He'd
endure it for Copper's sake--and to get out of here quietly. Alexander

as he pushed the call button. He could feel the cold sweat form on his

it was healthy or not. From what Kennon could remember of veterinary

Shortliner connections with other worlds were infrequent. Beta had done
a good job separating from the rest of the Brotherhood. Too good. The
spaceline schedules showed only one departure in the next month, a
Shortliner for Earth, and from Earth the road to Kardon was long and
tortuous, involving a series of short jumps from world to world and a
final medium-range hop from Halsey to Kardon. If everything went right
and he made every connection he would be in Kardon four months after he
left Beta. Kennon sighed as he left Travelers Aid. Morality was a heavy
Co-operative where he had been staying. He had left Huntersville and
Copper a week ago, after he had seen his child. His child! The thought
of being a father was oddly dismaying. It distorted his sense of values.
But one thing was certain. He was returning to Kardon, and Copper was
not coming with him. She had a duty to their son--and he had a duty to
his contract with Alexander, to the Lani on Flora, and to Copper--and
none of these could be satisfied by further running. He had to return
in front of his room. "My name is Richter," he said "--Art Richter. Are
you by sight." He sighed. "One has to observe the formalities in this
business." He drew a long white envelope from his tunic and handed it to
"I really thought this would be harder, considering the charges against
man Richter was undoubtedly a process server--but who had hired him?
He unfolded the sheet and scanned the charges--coercion, larceny,
livestock theft, and breach of contract. He shrugged. This was
Alexander's work. What was the man thinking of? It was insanity to
bring the Lani matter into open court. Hadn't Douglas told him what had
happened? Couldn't Alexander guess that he had fled with Copper for a
good reason--one that would stand up in court? Didn't he know about the
spacer? Or had Douglas turned on his cousin? The pup had so many hates
that it was possible. He was a natural troublemaker. Maybe Alexander
didn't know. Maybe he was working in the dark. Kennon scanned the sheet
quickly. Ah! here it was. Complaint--Mr. Alexander X. M. Alexander,
straight to the phone beside the bed. He lifted the handset from its
cradle and dialed the operator. "Get me Huntersville THU 2-1408. I want
to speak to Dr. Brainard, Dr. Will Brainard. This is a priority
call--my name is Kennon. Dr. Jac Kennon D.V.M. I'm in the registry--47M
26429--yes--of course, and thank you." He waited a moment. "Hello--Dr.
Brainard?--Kennon here. I've just had some news. Alexander's on Beta!
Yes--he served me with a summons. Can you get a restraining order to
prevent him from leaving? You can? Good! Here's his address." Kennon
rattled off the location. "Yes--I'm taking the next airboat to Beta
City. This should simplify things considerably.--Of course it should. He
was a fool to have come here. Yes--I suppose you should tell Copper.
Oh! She is? I'm sorry to hear that, but there's no reason for her to
be angry. She should realize that I did this for her--not to make her
miserable. Hmm.--She--she has? You think she should come with
me?--Yes, I realize she can be a problem when she wants to be. All right
then--tell her to pack a toothbrush and a few spare diapers. And see if
you can get me a couple of tickets on the next flight to Beta City. I'll
be over in a couple of hours and pick her up." He cradled the phone and
Alexander. Yes. I'll wait. This number is HUV 2-1278 and my name
is Kennon, Dr. Jac Kennon 47M 26429. I called you before. No, I'm a
transient. I can refer you to Dr. James Brainard, Huntersville Medical
Center. Yes, I'll accept charges. Now will you give me that number? BCA
you do, but I've been trying to get back to Kardon for the past month.
You are? Well, that's your privilege, but I'd advise you to go easy
until I see you. Naturally--I'm coming as soon as I can get there. We'll
be seeing you tomorrow morning at the latest. We?--I'm bringing Copper,
years hadn't served to cool him off. What had happened on Kardon after
he had left? Kennon shook his head. There was something here he didn't
understand. The entrepreneur should have been covering his tracks, not
threatening jail and disaccreditation. It was obvious that a personal
things before you took this case to court. You obviously do not
understand what has happened. I suppose Douglas has double-crossed you.
It would be characteristic of him. But before we go any further I think
we should clear the air and let each other know where we stand. I
don't want to make trouble if it's not necessary. You'll notice I'm not
wearing a thought screen, so you'll be able to check everything I say,
of breach of contract and larceny of corporation property, but there are
quite probably I can think of more if you beat these. I'm going to make
an example of you, Kennon. I'm going to drag you down and stamp on you.
You're going to be a horrible example to all smart operators who think
they can break contracts. It's taken a million credits and ten years'
legs from under him. "You believe it," he said. "--No--you've proved

we stopped when we found the age that was being indoctrinated with Lani
spaceship. I assumed it was one of those that were involved in that
commercial raid a few decades ago, but I see it wasn't. No--I knew
nothing about this development. And Douglas, I guess, wanted to keep
it hidden. He gave your co-ordinates and ordered Mullins to launch a
missile. But he apparently forgot to turn on his IFF. At any rate
the missile lost you--but found Douglas. Douglas was still talking to
before you could destroy Outworld Enterprises. His motives were selfish
as usual." Alexander looked at Kennon with a haggard eye. "I owe you an
apology," he said. "I've considered you responsible for Douglas's death
for ten years. I've searched for you on a hundred worlds. My agents in
every branch office have had standing orders to report any unusual
arrivals. I have hunted you personally. I wanted to break you--I wanted
reasons I came here. I wanted to see how you'd react when you learned
I could have checked it further. But I didn't. Outworld Enterprises is
far bigger than Flora--and I was busy. Galactic trade is a snake-pit.
And, after all, there was Douglas's death--and the Family with their
never-ending clamor for money and their threats when it didn't come
promptly. I like being an entrepreneur, but until I made Outworld
independent of Family control, I couldn't do anything except run the
business to their wishes. Actually the island was only a small part of
the corporation. I tried to run it as humanely as possible under the
circumstances." He shuddered. "I don't think I was ever needlessly

Handling the evidence that way was a wise course. You have my
admiration. But then I should have known that I was not dealing with a
settle this affair. It is a matter only you can handle. There is
no sense in killing Outworld or throwing Kardon into centuries of
litigation. The Lani never were numerous enough to lay claim to an
entire world. I'll admit the club is there, but I'll never use it unless
a little physically--and we've learned to use new tools, but our minds
are still the minds of barbarians--blood brothers against the enemy, and
everything not of us is enemy. Savages--hiding under a thin veneer
of superficial culture. Savages with spaceships and the atom." Kennon
looked down at Copper. Apparently her thoughts were miles away in an
introspective world that was all her own. She had said her piece and
having done that was content to let the two men develop it. Kennon
looked at her with odd respect. Alexander eyed her with a mildly
startled expression on his lean face. And both men smiled, but the
worry about how the Lani will turn out." He looked at Kennon with mild
I'm doing the guiding. I've changed a lot of my opinions about Copper
secrets neither of them would ever know. Alexander chuckled. "It serves
you right." He crossed his legs and looked up at Kennon standing before
him. By some uncanny legerdemain he had gotten control of himself
and the situation at the same time. Being telepathic was an unfair
"Sure--humanity makes mistakes, and like this one they're sometimes
brutal mistakes. But we are capable of atonement. Morally we have come a
long way from the brutality of the Interregnum. I shouldn't have to use
examples, but look at that"--he waved at the view wall at the panorama
of gleaming fairy towers and greenery that made Beta City one of the
most beautiful in the Brotherhood. "Don't tell me that five thousand
years of peace and development haven't produced civilization. That's a
beautifully designed for art and utility--but it isn't civilization.
You're confusing technology with culture. You look at this and say,
'What a great civilization man has built,' when you really mean, 'What
a great technology mankind has developed.' There's all the difference in
the world. Technology is of the mind and hands. Civilization is of the
humanity a closed corporation, a special club in which men can live but
aliens can't. We've made the standards for admission so rigid that
we even enslave our own kind and call them animals. That's not
fortune is based upon it. And you have perpetuated this traffic in flesh
on the specious reasoning that a court judgment of half a millennium ago
is as good today as when it was handed down. Never once did anyone have
the moral courage to re-examine that old decision. Never once did any
human question the rightness of that decision. None of us are immune.
We all based our conduct upon an antiquated law and searched no further.

you're not legally liable. It was a mistake. All you have to do is admit
the error and start from there. Naturally--no reasonable intelligence
would expect that you change the older Lani. They're too old for either
agerone or change. It would be both cruel and inhuman to turn them
loose. It's with the youngsters that you can work--those who are
physically and physiologically young enough to derive benefit from
to change things overnight. It's the future of the Lani race that's
important, And Brainard agrees with me. A phase-out is the proper
solution. Change the education, let males be born--teach the young to
think instead of to obey. Give them Phoebe for a home--they never owned
all of Kardon anyway. And within a century or two we will have a new
